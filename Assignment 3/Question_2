Explain the basic structure of a Streamlit app.

Streamlit allows us to write apps the same way we write python scripts.
For this streamlit uses a unique data flow.
That is,any time something is updated on the screen, Streamlit reruns the entire Python script from top to bottom.
This can happen whenever we modify our app's source code or when a user interacts with widgets in the app. 
For example, when dragging a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.
