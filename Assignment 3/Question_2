How can you add a title to your Streamlit app?

We can add title to a streamlit app by using the command streamlit.title(body).

import streamlit as st
st.title('This is mt title')
This st.title() function creates a title at the top of your Streamlit app. We can replace 'This is my title' with any desired title for the application.
